            Originally, I’m a fine arts Masters graduate specializing in photography, installation and a sprinkle of 3d art. After a “brief” passage by the hospital, I decided to reinvent myself professionally. I retrained my brain with the Introduction to Computer Science by the CS50, which was an amazing step to find my new way. With O’clock, I made my new professional aspiration a reality.

          As a visual artist, I’m a very meticulous person, who enjoys sharing ideas and solving problems. Also, my working experiences make me a very team oriented person. I’m here to learn as much as I can !
